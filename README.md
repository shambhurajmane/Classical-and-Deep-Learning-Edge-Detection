# Classical-and-Deep-Learning-Edge-Detection
This report presents a two-phase assignment focusing on boundary detection and neural network architecture evaluation. Thee objective is to develop a pb (probability of boundary) algorithm for efficient boundary detection in images. Phase 2, we will implement multiple neural network architectures for analysis on various criteria on CIFAR10 dataset.
